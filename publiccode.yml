      To have fully satisfied customers is complex. Conversation’s actors
      (chatbots and humans) should handoff to each other many times during a
      chat to address customers needs. 


      Tiledesk provides a solution **orchestrating instant, asynchronous and
      multichannel communication among all stakeholders of a typical
      conversational architecture**: chatbots, support operators, end users,
      colleagues, applications, etc.  


      **Main Features**: 


      - Live Chat Widget with full multichannel experience on Web and Mobile; 

      - No-Code Chatbot Builder to qualify more leads and automate customer 
      support; 

      - Adaptive multichannel technology to design conversational flow once, 
      then run it on every channel, from Whatsapp Business to Company Website

      - Team Organization with multi-project management, SLAs setting, smart
      assignment of the queues, departments organization and much more;

      - Seamless conversation to “jump” between different channels in a
      transparent way for end customers and agents; 

      - Chat Tools like typing indicator, off-line access, delivery receipts,
      contact list and much more; 

      - Dashboard with real time analytics;
