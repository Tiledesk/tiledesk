    longDescription: |
      Tiledesk is an AI platform that helps businesses build AI Agents to automate customer support and business processes across multiple channels, improving engagement and operational efficiency. 
      With an intuitive drag-and-drop builder and a no-code approach, teams can create, customize, and deploy AI-powered experiences without technical expertise. Tiledesk supports multiple use cases including customer service, marketing and sales, and internal support. 
      It is adaptable across industries such as e-commerce, financial services, and education. Tiledesk leverages advanced large language models to deliver natural, precise, and context-aware responses. With MCP, it goes beyond traditional chatbots by enabling agents to take actions and execute tasks through prompting instead of coding.


      **Key features**: 


      - No-code drag-and-drop builder: Build automation flows with AI actions such as AI prompts, AI conditions, knowledge base queries, and task steps; 

      - MCP for actionable AI Agents: Agents can perform real tasks, not only generate text. For example, update CRMs, send emails, manage spreadsheets, trigger webhooks, and connect to tools like Google Workspace, Slack, Shopify, and Notion using natural language instructions.; 

      - AI Agents beyond support: Automate routine workflows for operations, sales, and internal processes;

      - Knowledge base and RAG engine: Import knowledge from URLs and files to enable accurate, context-aware answers;

      - Self-learning AI Agent: When AI falls short, a human resolves the case. The agent learns from the resolution and improves future handling by generating new knowledge content automatically; 

      - Multichannel support: Deploy on WhatsApp Business and Facebook Messenger (both by Meta), plus other channels; 

      - AI-to-human handover: Escalate complex or critical cases to a human operator smoothly; 

      - Proactive WhatsApp messaging: Send promotions, seasonal campaigns, and engagement messages;
      
      - Real-time analytics dashboard: Track performance and outcomes with live reporting; 

      - Team and operations management: Multi-project management, SLA settings, smart assignment, queue management, department organization, and more;
